Alaina has worked in programming, engineering, robotics, software architecture, data science, and information security over 38 years. After completing the Graduate Studies Program (GSP '11) at Singularity University, she served as a Teaching Fellow in "Networks & Computing Systems" and "Digital Biology," and held the position of Chief Maker. She is the co-author of the genetic testing e-book ["Genetics: The Universe Within (2017)"](https://www.precisionnutrition.com/genetic-testing-ebook), and is currently a Principal Engineer.

Her academic interests center on bioinformatics, particularly genomics and human migration, which she examines through the framework of population genetics. She is curious about how shifting genetic landscapes can shed light on shared human heritage. In addition to her work in genomics, she applies scientific methods to the study of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP), exploring how potential non-terrestrial evolutionary models might inform our broader understanding of lifeâ€™s origins and possibilities.

At The Visible College, she oversees technical projects and collaborates with colleagues to blend computational approaches with research in various academic fields. Her background in technology and long-standing enthusiasm for interdisciplinary studies guide her investigations, while her practical experience supports a balanced perspective on emerging areas of inquiry.
