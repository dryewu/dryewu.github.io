Jed received his Ph.D. in Tibetan Buddhism from the University of Virginia (UVa). From 2012-2014, he served as the Director of Contemplative Technologies at UVa's [Contemplative Sciences Center](https://csc.virginia.edu/), researching brain-computer interface (BCI) technologies and working to establish a cutting edge curriculum for teaching contemplative values and practices.

In 2014, Jed left to start Sentient Applications, a consulting organization that sought to work on comparable issues in the private sector. Sentient soon joined forces with a team of data scientists to form Timbr, which contracted with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). In 2016, Timbr was acquired by DigitalGlobe, a satellite company based in Westminster, CO (soon to become part of Maxar Technologies). Since 2019, Jed has worked at GitHub, Inc.
