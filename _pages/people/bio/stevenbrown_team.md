Steve is currently an Associate Professor of Teaching Philosophy at The Ohio State University, but his path through academia has been somewhat non-traditional. In addition to his regular teaching duties, he has had the privilege of working on several projects that attempt to bridge the gap between academic philosophy and the rest of the world. For a season, he served as Executive Director of the Maximin Project where he used contemporary data visualization and web development tools to promote principled and effective charitable giving. Afterwards he became Associate Director of OSU’s Center for Ethics and Human Values where he helped organize a broad range of events at the intersection of morality, politics, and society. He was also honored to participate in multiple efforts to increase access to arts programming and education inside Ohio prisons.

For a whole host of reasons, Steve believes that humanity is standing at a pivotal crossroads, with opportunities to completely rethink our life on Earth. As the leader of the Visible College, Steve’s mission is to spotlight these pressing issues and bring together scholars from around the world to apply their expertise in addressing them.
